## Problem 2

First, I will import and clean the homicide data that was gathered by
The Washington Post and describe the raw data.

``` r
homicide =
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

**Description**: This homicides dataset collected by The Washington Post
includes data on 52179 in 50 of the largest American cities. The dataset
contains 12 variables, including: the report date of the murder
(`report_date`), the victim’s first and last name (`victim_first`,
`victim_last`), key demographics of the victim (`victim_race`,
`victim_age`, `victim_sex`), the location (`city`, `state`, `lat`,
`lon`), and the status of the case (`disposition`).

Next, I will tidy the data by using `mutate` to ensure appropriate data
types and to make a `city_state` variable. Then, I will summarize within
cities to obtain the total number of homicides and number of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
homicidetidy = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(str_c(city, state, sep = ", ")), 
         reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date),"%Y%m%d"), 
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), 
         victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex),
         victim_race = as.factor(victim_race), 
         city = as.factor(city),
         state = as.factor(state))
```
